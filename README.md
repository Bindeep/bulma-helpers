# bulma-helpers
Library with missing **Functional / Atomic CSS selectors for Bulma framework**, which doesn't require Bulma framework to work! :heart:

## Quick install

Installation is nearly the same as pure Bulma framework.

### NPM
```sh
npm install bulma-helpers
```
**or**

### Yarn

```sh
yarn add bulma-helpers
```
### Import
After installation, you can import the CSS file into your project using this snippet:

```sh
import 'bulma-helpers/css/bulma-helpers.min.css'
```

## CSS only

Bulma-helpers, equally to Bulma, is a **CSS** library. As such, the sole output is a single CSS file: [bulma-helpers.css](https://github.com/jmaczan/bulma-helpers/blob/master/css/bulma-helpers.css)

You can either use that file, "out of the box", or download the Sass source files to customize the variables or choose which modules do you want to use.

There is **no** JavaScript included.

## Browser Support

Bulma-helpers, equally to Bulma, uses [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) to make (most) Flexbox features compatible with earlier browser versions. According to [Can I use](https://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox), Bulma is compatible with **recent** versions of:

* Chrome
* Edge
* Firefox
* Opera
* Safari

Internet Explorer (10+) is only partially supported.
